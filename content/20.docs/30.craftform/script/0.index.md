# Introduction to script.py

Craft behaviour customization is done in a `script.py` file.
The behaviour you can adapt to your needs are :

`* [drop_file](drop_file.md)`
`* [generate](generate.md)`
`* [delivery](delivery.md)`

## callbacks

All callback functions are of the form:
```
async def callback_function(ctx: ICraftContext, *args)
```

`The [ICraftContext](../ICraftContext.md) give the function a craft context object.`
