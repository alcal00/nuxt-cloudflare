# menu

We use the `aside` property to display a menu.
See [docus configuration](https://docus.dev/introduction/writing-pages).

Please note that only one level is displayed.

If you want to put some pages in this top level menu,
you need to create an *empty* redirect md page.

For exemple the MD page `pricing_go.md` with the following content will be displayed as `pricing` and redirect to `/pricing` :

```yaml
---
title: pricing
redirect: /pricing
---
```

The markdown page MUST have a different name.
